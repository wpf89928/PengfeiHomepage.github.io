My name is Wei Pengfei. I am currently a research scientist in the AI lab of Bytedance. Our team is recruiting new members, and welcome to join us! All the positions are available [here](https://job.toutiao.com/s/F9fU3aq).

Before I joined Bytedance, I worked as a research fellow in the Medcomp Lab of National University of Singapore from May 2019 to March 2021 (advisor: Prof. [Leong Tze Yun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leongty/Home.html)). I recieved my PhD degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2019. My PhD supervisor is Prof. [Ke Yiping](https://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=YPKE&CategoryDescription=ComputerScienceandEngineering).

Research Interests
======
My research interests inculde transfer learning, domain adaptation, reinforcement learning and their interdisciplinary topics as well as thier applications to computer vision, natural langauge process, speech signal processing and system engineering etc.
