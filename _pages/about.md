My name is Wei Pengfei. I am currently a research scientist in the AI lab of Bytedance. Our team is recruiting new members, and welcome to join us! All the positions are available [here](https://job.toutiao.com/s/F9fU3aq).

Before I joined Bytedance, I worked as a research fellow in the Medcomp Lab of National University of Singapore from May 2018 to March 2020 (advisor: Prof. [Leong Tze Yun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leongty/Home.html)). I recieved my PhD degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2019. My PhD supervisor is Prof. [Ke Yiping](https://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=YPKE&CategoryDescription=ComputerScienceandEngineering).

Research Interests
======
